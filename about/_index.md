A Sydney-based designer turning new technology and complex business to likable product. Finishing my last semester of Master in Interaction Design in University of Sydney.

Prior, I helped making travelling easier at [Wego](https://www.wego.com). My favourite part in design career has been building a culture of collaborating, enabling each other to design better in any team that I works in. I love spending my time with talented people building great products together. 

Originally a front-end engineer building responsive websites, I was fasciated with how design can make things easier for people, I became a self-taught designer and have been enjoying this journey so far.

I am interested in designing for products that enable people to have more meaningful interaction with other human beings. Feel free say hi if you want to collaborate on such product.
