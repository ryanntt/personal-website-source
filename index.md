## Hello, I'm Ryan.

I am a designer for the web, interaction design and animation. 

I'm currently working in Singapore for [Wego](http://www.wego.com) as a designer in Web Experience team. Outside of work, I like to have fun on a few [side projects](/projects).

I recently start writing about design and life on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ryanntt). I save a copy of my blog [here](/blog) just in case something similar to my first website on GeoCities happend. It's a long story.

I love and write about photography on [Tumblr](http://chillingkat.com). Ready to roll anytime with my Olympus 35RC and Kodak film.
