## Overview

### About Cadigal Green

blah blah 

### Design Brief

What we get from the course

### How We Worked

I worked together with Naiyu Wang and Patrick Chi in this project, using human-centered design methodology to understand, define problem, then explore and create solution (*see diagram below*).



### Methods We Used

In this case study, I want to highlight some of the most important human-centered design methods we used.

## Understanding The Problem


### The Role of Feedback in Improving Healthcare system

The feedback provided by patient at different stage of the experience pathway and cross different path ways can help form a complementary instrument in evaluating the delivery of integrated care. The insights will be used to facilitate the improvement in quality of integrated care in the NSW public hospital sector.

### Observation



> "People give feedback about doctor, but not necessarily about the hospital. There are good and bad doctor in the hospital" - A person commented on Facebook review.

### On-site Interview




## Define Problem



### Framed Problem

What is a framed problem? Framed problem is a statement that specify the problem to the extent that everyone in design team can understand it as well as the direction of solution. According to IDEO Human-Centered Design Framework, having a framed problem helps design team have the right understanding of the problem, be more confident in exploring creative possibilities and solutions.

## Making Process

### Design Principles

Before brainstorming ideas, we agreed on a set of principles to guide our solutions. This created constraints for our ideas and kept us aligned. Within these boundaries, we had freedom to explore many well-focused ideas.

</figure>

### Ideation

We started with 3 different ideas of how to collect feedbacks from users. However, our solution focused on single aspects of problem:
- Visibility and accessibility - Idea #1
- Transparency and trust - Idea #2
- Engaging feedback - Idea #3

### Storyboard

We drew storyboards for our three personas James, Lucy and Wesley to visualise how people will use the product. We then used the storyboards as testing scenarios.

## Create Solution

### Prototype

We combined the strength of our ideas and improved their drawbacks to produce a prototype that follows our design principles. The prototype include:
- Designed space for giving accurate feedback.
- Feedback form in tablet for convenience.
- Interactive feedback visualisation to monitor feedback status.

### User Testing

The hypotheses we are testing with this prototype are:
- The stress-free atmosphere can help facilitate communication and feedback.
- People would like to give the feedback in a fast and direct way.
- People would like to track feedback status and view othersâ€™ feedback.

User Scenarios for testing:
- Participant is immersed in Healing Garden Simulation
- Participant gives feedback via digital form on tablet
- Participant tries VR/AR demo to have fun and give feedback
- Participant interacts with Feedback Data Visualization

The testing gave us a generally positive results with some minor problems in the interface of feedback form. Most people feel satisfied after giving the feedback and would like to use the product if implemented in hospitals. Most importantly, our hypotheses were proven to be true.

### Iteration

I implemented the insights from user testing to the interface of feedback form. [Min Yi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/min-yi-tan-648039127/) rewrote the copy to make it more engaging and friendly. [Elektra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elektra-jiang-099546129/) redesigned the interactive feedback wall.

### Final Solution

We kept improving the design and getting feedback via user testing. Regarding time constraint of the project, we are satisfied with the final solution.

### Walkthrough Video

We created a video to help people visualise how they can our prodcuts to give and review feedbacks in hospital.

### Reflection

What I find most useful in this project is conducting interviews and analysing the result using research method to extract insights from it. It was easy to have a fixed mindset in the beginning about problem but *being open-minded and using analytical thinking led us to new insights of the actual problem*.

Working in a team with people from different background (Marketing, Design, Media) is rewarding and challenging. *Seeing problems from perspectives of users and working on solutions from different disciplines* help us have creative solutions and possibilities.

Following human-centred design thoroughly was tiring at some points, but *practicing them make us understand the framework much more than reading about it*.
