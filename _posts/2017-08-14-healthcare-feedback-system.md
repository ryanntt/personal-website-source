## Overview

### Design Brief

In Redbank House, currently patients give feedback at admission, midterm through their care course, end of the course, and there is also a follow-up survey but these are not well integrated and hard to get useful information out of them. A design project would be to make these more **accessible** and **efficient**, align them and design them in a way that they are connected.

### About Redbank House

Redbank House was founded in the late 1970s to provide tertiary diagnosis and treatment for children, adolescents and families having mental health problems. It is part of Westmead Hospital, New South Wales, Australia.

### How We Worked

I worked together with [Min Yi Tan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/min-yi-tan-648039127/) and [Elektra Jiang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elektra-jiang-099546129/) in this project, using human-centered design methodology to understand, define problem, then explore and create solution (*see diagram below*).

### Methods We Used

In this case study, I want to highlight some of the most important human-centered design methods we used.

## Understand Problem


### The Role of Feedback in Improving Healthcare system

The feedback provided by patient at different stage of the experience pathway and cross different path ways can help form a complementary instrument in evaluating the delivery of integrated care. The insights will be used to facilitate the improvement in quality of integrated care in the NSW public hospital sector. (Sutherland, & Levesque, 2014)

### Online Ethnography

We recognised the trend of people giving reviews about services, including healthcare, on social channels such as Facebook and Google. 

- People described their unpleasant experience in details on Facebook Google Pages.
- Some people didn't agree with the feedback given, thinking it was unfair to the doctors.

> "People give feedback about doctor, but not necessarily about the hospital. There are good and bad doctor in the hospital" - A person commented on Facebook review.

### On-site Interview

The interviews were conducted at several hospitals in Sydney, including:

- Redbank House (Westmead Hospital) - Our focus
- Sydney Children Hospital

Around 25 peopel interviewed include:
- Patients going for monthly checkup
- Relative and parents of chidlren participating in the treatment program
- Social workers in the hospitals

### Shadowing

We followed a psychologist in Redbank House for a few hours to understand the process of designing, collecting and processing feedback forms.

### Redbank House Feedback Process

#### Collecting feedback

- **Admission**: Parent receive the package including questionnaires about demographics, symptom identification.
- **Weekly**: Parents meet specialist weekly to discuss the status of the child and give feedback on the treatment → Qualitative feedback.
- **Discharge**: At the end of the program, parents receive form to give feedback on the quality of the service. → Quantitative feedback

#### Data Analysis

- Hospital Admin person input the data into database
- Specialist/Social workers run SPSS to analyze data creating insights, then share those with other specialists

### User Journey

People going to hospital for checkup have different concerns at different touchpoints. We used customer journey to identify the area of problems, and potentially when to offer our solution.

## Define Problem

### Problem Prioritisation

Having discovered other problems in other areas in Redbank House aside from feedback, we want to focus on problems that we can solved within limited time of the project. We used the Impact/Effort scale, commonly ultilised in product development, to figure out the priorities.

Impact is measured by frustration level and the the number of people benefits from
potential solution. High impact means high number people having frustration greatly
reduced (Traynor, 2017).

Effort is measured by how unique and complex the solution will be. High effort means
potential solution is unique and highly complex, and that not many of current existing
solutions haven’t been able to fix the problems well (Porter, J., & Brewer, J. , 2010).

### Problems in Giving Feedback

We used affinity mapping to group similar problem together and created painpoints themes to understand the core problems. There are 4 of them:

</figure>


### Our Potential Users

We then created 3 personas representing our potential users in order to empathise with them:
- **James**: 61 year-old grandfather who doesn't have much use for digital technology in his daily life.
- **Lucy**: 32 year-old girl with a full-on job, living with two uni mates.
- **Wesley**: 23 years-old male, forever young at heart: no big long-term plans for life – he'll ride the waves as they come.

### Framed Problem

According to IDEO Human-Centered Design Framework, having a framed problem helps design team have the right understanding of the problem, be more confident in exploring creative possibilities and solutions.

## Explore Solution

### Design Principles

Before brainstorming ideas, we agreed on a set of principles to guide our solutions. This created constraints for our ideas and kept us aligned. Within these boundaries, we had freedom to explore many well-focused ideas.

</figure>

### Ideation

We started with 3 different ideas of how to collect feedbacks from users. However, our solution focused on single aspects of problem:
- Visibility and accessibility - Idea #1
- Transparency and trust - Idea #2
- Engaging feedback - Idea #3

### Storyboard

We drew storyboards for our three personas James, Lucy and Wesley to visualise how people will use the product. We then used the storyboards as testing scenarios.

## Create Solution

### Prototype

We combined the strength of our ideas and improved their drawbacks to produce a prototype that follows our design principles. The prototype include:
- Designed space for giving accurate feedback.
- Feedback form in tablet for convenience.
- Interactive feedback visualisation to monitor feedback status.

### User Testing

The hypotheses we are testing with this prototype are:
- The stress-free atmosphere can help facilitate communication and feedback.
- People would like to give the feedback in a fast and direct way.
- People would like to track feedback status and view others’ feedback.

User Scenarios for testing:
- Participant is immersed in Healing Garden Simulation
- Participant gives feedback via digital form on tablet
- Participant tries VR/AR demo to have fun and give feedback
- Participant interacts with Feedback Data Visualization

    <figcaption>We recorded participant's reaction during the test</figcaption>
</figure>

The testing gave us a genenrally positive results with some minor problems in the interface of feedback form. Most people feel satisfied after giving the feedback and would like to use the product if implemented in hospitals. Most importantly, our hypotheses were proven to be true.

### Interation

I implemented the insights from user testing to the interface of feedback form. [Min Yi] rewrote the copy to make it more engaging and friendly. [Elektra] redesigned the interactive feedback wall.

### Final Solution

We kept improving the design and getting feedback via user testing. Regarding time constraint of the project, we are satisfied with the final solution.

### Reflection

What I find most useful in this project is conducting interviews and analysing the result using research method to extract insights from it. It was easy to have a fixed mindset in the beginning about problem but *being open-minded and using analytical thinking led us to new insights of the actual problem*.

Working in a team with people from different background (Marketing, Design, Media) is rewarding and challenging. *Seeing problems from perspectives of users and working on solutions from different disciplines* help us have creative solutions and possibilities.

Following human-centred design thoroughly was tiring at some points, but *practicing them make us understand the framework much more than reading about it*.
