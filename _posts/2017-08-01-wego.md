summary: <p>Wego is the largest online travel marketplace in the Middle East and North Africa. In 2016, the search experience was redesigned to acommodate the changing demographics of Wego users having various usage.</p> <p>We were tasked to help travellers find their travel packages quickly, and at the same time bring the right travel products provided by our business partners to the right customers. The focused metric was the conversion rate of the search funnel.</p>

<!-- From April of 2015 to January 2017, I worked in Wego, a Singapore-based travel company that helps travellers make right choice of flight and accommodation through search and booking service on Wego. -->

<!-- I was the lead designer of Web team, collaborating with developer, product managers, people from marketing, hotel and flight business development, advertising and data to make sure we bring people to the right products, and prodivde travel business with the right customers. -->

## Role

I led the design project from research phase in June 2016 to the finalisation of the interface design in January 2017. I worked as the only designer for Flight Search and with another designer in designing for Hotel Search.

## Problems

As travelling had become more accessible and affordable to people, designing for any travel marketplace needed to consider different needs of all customers. The diversity in purposes and demographics of travellers posed a challenge in designing for Wego to help customers find the right travel products.

We gathered customers' qualitative feedback and recognised that people had many different expectations when reaching our platform. These expectations were either different or higher than what we designed the search experience in 2013 for. We also recognised many drop-off points in the search funnel in Google Analytics, which validated our initial qualitative insights.

## Solution

### Transparent + Fair = Trustworthy

A meta-search website build trustworthiness by being transparent about available data and fair to all products in the marketplace. With a database having data of all flights and hotels, we provide transparent travel information so that people can make informed decision. Having more data comes with the responsibility to extract and show the meaningful bits. An user-centric marketplace does not simply display as many products as possible, but need to make the decision-making process worry-free for the customers. We also wanted to show the right products from our partners to our users without any hidden bias.

### Transparent

A problem for any travel search engine is the time required for data polling after user hit button Search, which make people feel like waiting for long time. In this design concept, the problem is solved by a progressive loading animation. The new loading animation intend to create a sense of frictionless experience, taking people to their exciting destination by having big image and "opening up" movement of elements. My idea is inspired by article The [Illusion of Time, by Adrian](https://medium.com/swlh/the-illusion-of-time-8f321fa2f191), which introduces solving time perception with illusion, instead of actual speed. The design also displays which business partners our platform is working with to provide the best results. 

<!-- In search result page, different elements including filters, flight cards, promotional ads are arranged in sequence to avoid cognitive overloading for user, helping them understand the results. This also helps achieve business objectives of having ads and marketing element in the future.  -->

### Fair

We wanted to help customers, both experienced and inexperienced travellers, make informed decision based on their travel preferences. At the same time, we wanted to help bring the right travel products from our business partners to the right customers.

### Flexible + Helpful = Empowering

The act of searching is active, and, therefore, we want to empower our customer with flexible ways to view the results and be responsive and helpful when they are likely to be confused.

### Helpful

 Most customers want to get the cheapest (with flexible timing), the fastest (to save time), or the most comfortable (especially long flight) options. We, therefore, made these the sorting orders to improve their usage.

    <figcaption>To help those customers not used to filters, we provide contextual filters for flight search.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Flexible

The collapsible filters allow a quick overview of what people can select. The UI components such as dropdown, slider and checkbox are used to help user find their preferred flights. The status at the top shows how many flights are being displayed out of how many flights found in the search unfiltered. When people choose Show All, all filters are reset. The copy Show All is proven to be clearer than Reset. Google Analytics showed that using certain filters lead to higher conversion rate of booking. The order of filters was based on this finding.

<!-- The hotels map feature was launched on Wego mobile app in November 2015.  -->
<!-- I worked with our mobile interface designer, Herajeng, to create this prototype. It was to demonstrate how different elements in map view work together. This helped mobile developers understand the specs of design and build a successful feature being used by millions of people. -->
In mobile interface, the filter control stays at bottom of the screen for better usability. The commonly used filters are visible while other filters are accessed through button More.

<!-- I started prototyping on Framerjs since it included the logics of interface and how elements animate. Due to some reasons, the shared link doesn't show the same prototype with what I have on local Framer Studio and has few bugs. I changed to Principle for Mac and realised its amazing speed of building animation with simple logics. The Framer prototype still served its purpose as I managed to code quite complex logics in the map view so it works like a real app while Principle prototype showed better animation. -->

<!-- The prototype was iterated according to feedback I received from product managers and design team. -->

<!-- ### Redesign Search Experience

Both hotel and flight search experience are focused on understanding different customer needs when they are looking for travelproduct. As hoteliers, travel agencies and airlines provide product with more complexity, the challenge of my job is to make this complexity easily comprehensible to travellers when they search on Wego. 

I worked on incremental design project that optimised the search flow, display of details and also a design revamp project that change the fundamental of search experience on web products.The incremental design were used as experimental projects to validate hypothesis and understand user behaviours using A/B testing and Google Analytics to analyse conversion flow. These insights were used as knowledge to support the need for fundamental change in the revamp project. I worked in design revamp project from June 2016 to January 2017. The project went live in June 2018 and has been working the same since then. Below are the works done in Redesign Search Experience project. -->

## Component-based design process

As our products are on desktop, tablet, mobile devices with different screen sizes, we designed the responsive components firstly then compiled them all into pages and screens. Each component went through many rounds of iteration and the library of components is maintained and shared among designers in our team.

## Results

The redesign of search experience was launched in July 2017. Conversion rate from the search form to the handoffs to our partners' website went up significantly. The usage rate of filters was higher. After this launch, Wego received [another round of funding](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/299724) in August and September 2017.
