## Project Summary

Drivers in human-driven car and pedestrians communicate with each other via eye contact and hand gesture, which do not exist in autonomous cars. With autonomous cars being tested in many cities around the world, the lack of interpersonal communication poses a challenge in having clear communication between autonomous cars and pedestrian.

This project aims to design a communication solution and answer the question of how people understand and trust this solution in their interaction with driverless cars, especially in the situation not regulated by a traffic light. The existing frameworks have identified intent and awareness as key factors to be considered for trusted communication between driverless cars and pedestrian. This study observed and analysed 16 participants in different scenarios at a pedestrian crossing having no traffic light.

In the process of designing for interaction between pedestrians and driverless cars, prototyping a novel solution with physical materials is difficult due to required cost and time. Virtual Reality(VR) was chosen in this project as the most suitable medium to study people's perception toward our solution.

The result confirms that the comfort and intention of the cars understood by pedestrian contribute to the overall trust toward communication with driverless vehicles. Participants did not rely significantly on knowing whether the car is aware of their presence to make a decision. The use of Virtual Reality as a testing medium is proven to be effective as participants exhibited emotions and behaviours that they normally have shown in real life situations.
