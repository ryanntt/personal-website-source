This is an on-going project about how I design a mobile application to help commuter to be notified when they are reaching their destination.

## Project Background

I slept on bus for a few time and missed the bus stop many times. It happens mostly when I commute alone.

## Needfinding

### Obeservation and Interview

The need is initially from my personal life. I notices the same problem for many friends. Sometimes when we took night bus, 1 of us needs to be awake. 

I ask my colleagues about if they have ever encounter the same situation. One of my colleagues likes listening to music and he sometimes forgot to get off the train.

### Needs/Goals of People

- Be notified when they are near destination
- The notification can awake the passenger if they are sleeping

### Ideas for product

The design solution will let user know when he/she is close to his destination. This is addressed on many citiesâ€™ public transportation. For individuals living on cities that have no such system, the solution should be integrated in his belonging that can notifies him. A mobile application will be a good direction.

### Inspiration

- Alarm clock
- The announcement on train before every station
- The announcement on flight 20 minutes before landing

### Prototype

I created this prototype on MarvelApp and give to people for feedbacks.

## Feedbacks and Challenges

- Selecting destination flow needs be more flexible since not-well-addressed destination can not be searched. Solution references: Uber, Grab
- Integration with bus stops map will help user visualize the path easier. Solution References: Citymapper
- The prototype will need more working functionalities to be used in daily life. User want to try it out on daily basis to give more helpful feedbacks. Solution: to build mock app on FramerJS with geofencing and notification features.
