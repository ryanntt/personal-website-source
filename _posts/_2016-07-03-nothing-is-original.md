summary: or How to stop worrying about being original and start creating solution
---

_In my life so far, I have done nothing original_

I didn't like to solve problem that some one already solved. I thought the solution was perfect. 

I thought the original solution comes from a original problem. I was wrong. Most of great solutions tackled old problem with different perspectives.

I was often satisfied with existing solution and thought I coudln't come up with something better. I was wrong. There is always a better one. 

Reinventing the wheel is waste of time. But understanding how the wheel works in order to create a better solution is not. From now on, when I try to solve an old problem, I will look at how it has been being solved and ask if it can be improved. 

Being original is about being better rather than being the first. 

I have recently learnt more about myself than "users".
