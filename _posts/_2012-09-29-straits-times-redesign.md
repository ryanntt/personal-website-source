summary: Redesign website of The Straits Times for better news reading
---

This project is about redesigning website of The Straits Times for better news reading. 

## Project Overivew
In 2012, I found reading news on www.straitstimes.com frustrating due to cluttered categories of news and too many links. Therefore, I wanted to give it a try on improving the website. This is a group project. My friend, Willy, helped me with the sitemap. From sitemap, we discussed the wireframe and then I created the final design on Adobe Illustrator.
